This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
data <- read.table('octave_data.txt', sep = )

names = c('participant', 'session','block', 'trial', 'effector','goalPos', 'jumpTim',  'jumpPos',  'fixT','alReaT',  'resPos',  't_draw',  't_touched',  't_go',  't_movStart',  't_jump',  't_movEnd',  't_goal', 't_end', 'reaT', 'gapT','processT', 'correct')

colnames(data) <- names
```

The raw data should be cleaned (too short reaction times, non-smooth trajectories, wrong responses) 

```{r}
# make 2 different data sets: valid responses and invalid responses
# conditions: 
# 1. response field is available
# 2. reaction time is not longer than allowed (individual value p.p.)
# 3. reaction time is not faster than 3 sd under mean

iv_data <- data[which(data$resPos=='NaN'),]
v_data  <- data[which(data$resPos!='NaN'),]
v_data  <- v_data[which(v_data$reaT>0.1),]
head(v_data)
```

1. make an overview of variables that should be regularly distributed
- equal number of goal left and right after cleaning
- uniform distribution of jump times
- linear correlation between jump time and jump pos

2. some things that should be an effect
- reaction times differ between participants
- reaction times do not differ between left and right goals
- reaction times depend of effector
- reaction times do not depend on block
- (almost) linear relation between gapT and processT

3. experimental checks
- correct/not is predicted by processT (better than by gapT)
- correct/not is not predicted by reaction time


```{r}
# sanity checks

# roughly the same number of left and right goals
table(v_data$goalPos)

# uniform distribution of jump times
j_times <- ggplot(data = v_data, aes(trial,jumpTim)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = as.factor(block)))
j_times

# linear correlation between jump times and jump pos
time_pos <- ggplot(data = v_data, aes(jumpTim,jumpPos))+
  geom_smooth(method= 'loess', formula = y~x)
time_pos

```

```{r}
# extended sanity check
# 1. no difference in reaction time between movments to the left and to the right
tar_left  <- v_data$reaT[which(v_data$goalPos ==1)]
tar_right <- v_data$reaT[which(v_data$goalPos ==2)]

mean(tar_left)
mean(tar_right)

t.test(tar_left,tar_right)

# no dependence of reaction time on block
rea_block <- aov(reaT~block, data = v_data)
summary(rea_block)

# dependence of gapT and processT
gap_process <- aov(processT~gapT*reaT, data = v_data)
summary(gap_process)

# linear correlation between jump times and jump pos
gap_pro_plot <- ggplot(data = v_data, aes(gapT,processT))+
  geom_smooth(method= 'loess', formula = y~x)
gap_pro_plot

# dependence of gapT and reaT
gap_rea    <- aov(reaT~gapT, data = v_data)
summary(gap_rea)
```
